The technique is now used to provide surveillance over a larger geographical area.\nThe Multilateration is an independent Surveillance technique that employs a number of ground stations, placed in TMAs or En-route (or on the airports). The system exploits the 1090 MHz transmissions from aircraft. From these signals it creates a track containing identity, position, height etc., using the time difference of arrival of the signals to the multi-lateration ground stations. The deployment of such systems is already taking place in many areas of Europe exploiting the relatively lower cost compared to a radar, providing surveillance in volumes of airspace not suited to the use of conventional surveillance systems as well as supporting the future evolution towards ADS-B.",

The majority of PSR radars for TMA operate in S-Band while the longer range radars operate in L-Band. Mono-static Primary radars are currently the only existing Independent Non-cooperative Surveillance technology. The civil application of Multi-Static Primary Surveillance Radar (MSPSR) is under development. These distributed systems will offer solutions to many of the issues that beset current PSR sensors \u00e2\u0080\u0093 (namely extensive spectrum requirements, sensitivity to clutter, high cost etc.)",

The technique is now used to provide surveillance over a larger geographical area.\nThe Multilateration is an independent Surveillance technique that employs a number of ground stations, placed in TMAs or En-route (or on the airports). The system exploits the 1090 MHz transmissions from aircraft. From these signals it creates a track containing identity, position, height etc., using the time difference of arrival of the signals to the multi-lateration ground stations. The deployment of such systems is already taking place in many areas of Europe exploiting the relatively lower cost compared to a radar, providing surveillance in volumes of airspace not suited to the use of conventional surveillance systems as well as supporting the future evolution towards ADS-B.",
